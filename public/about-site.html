                        Gardenara is a calm, relaxing game that grants users
                        their own garden and the ability to plant all kinds of
                        plants, based on real plants.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gardenara's mission: To bring enjoyment, tranquility,
                        and peace through a simple yet enjoyable gardening game
                        with simple tasks and works that make the game all the
                        more enjoyable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Upon first logging onto the game, users will be given
                        their first seeds, three strawberry and tomato seeds, and the game will
                        teach them the mechanics of growing plants. Once the
                        player plants a seed, it will have to go through three
                        stages of growth before it can be sold; Seed(when the
                        plant has just been planted), Seedling(when the plant
                        has first sprouted), and Adult(when the plant is fully
                        grown and now may be sold). To upgrade from one stage to
                        another, the plant needs one dose of fertilizer and
                        water. However for this preview, there is only the watering mechanics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are four main plant types; Flowers, leafy plants,
                        vegetables, and fruits, where each of them need a
                        different type of fertilizer to thrive. High P
                        fertilizer for flowers, High N fertilizer for leafy
                        plants, High K fertilizer for fruits, and 3-in-1
                        fertilizer for vegetables.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The player gets three strawberry and tomato seedd and two doses of High P
                        and 3-in-1 fertilizer for free at the beginning of the game, but
                        will need to purchase more seeds and fertilizer in the
                        shop. A fully grown plant may be sold for 12 coins, one
                        seed costing 3 coins and one dose of fertilizer costing
                        4 coins each in the shop.
