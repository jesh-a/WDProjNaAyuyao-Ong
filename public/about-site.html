    <p> Gardenara is a calm, relaxing game that grants users their own garden and the ability to plant all kinds of plants, based on real plants. </p>
    
    <p> 
        Gardenara's mission: To bring enjoyment, tranquility, and peace through a simple yet enjoyable gardening game with simple tasks and works that make the game all the more enjoyable.
    </p>
    
    <p> Upon first logging onto the game, users will be given their first seed, a sunflower seed, and the game will teach them the mechanics of growing plants. 
        Once the player plants a seed, it will have to go through three stages of growth before it can be sold; Seed(when the plant has just been planted), 
        Seedling(when the plant has first sprouted), and Adult(when the plant is fully grown and now may be sold). To upgrade from one stage to another, 
        the plant needs one dose of fertilizer and water. </p>
    
    <p> There are four main plant types; Flowers, leafy plants, vegetables, and fruits, where each of them need a different type of fertilizer to thrive. 
        High P fertilizer for flowers, High N fertilizer for leafy plants, High K fertilizer for fruits, and 3-in-1 fertilizer for vegetables. </p>
    
    <p> The player gets a sunflower seed and two doses of High P fertilizer for free at the beginning of the game, but will need to purchase more seeds and fertilizer in the shop. 
        A fully grown plant may be sold for 12 coins, one seed costing 3 coins and one dose of fertilizer costing 4 coins each in the shop.
